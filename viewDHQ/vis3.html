<h1>3. Filter for articles with five or more edges</h1>

<p>To look at this dataset in another way, we filter for degree range; degree is the number of edges attached to a node, signifying <strong>how many other works cite it or are cited by it</strong>. This visualization filters out those nodes with degree less than 5 in order to highlight the more interconnected works, and we label each edge with the name of the target article (so the links between nodes demonstrate what cited knowledge we're pointing at).</p>
<p>
You know a DH visualization is successfully highlighting the most-connected articles when "bush1945" shows as one of the most-interlinked nodes! "Bush1945" is Vannevar Bush's pivotal 1945 "As We May Think" article, which describes a hypothetical collective knowledge machine, the "memex"; the article predicted a number of later technologies important to the DH community such as hypertext and Wikipedia. Other heavily interconnected (i.e. cited) works include Jerome McGann's <em>Radiant Textuality: Literature after the World Wide Web</em> and Peter Shillingsburg's 2006 <em>From Gutenberg to Google: Electronic Representations of Literary Texts</em>.</p>
<p>Next, let's <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis4.html">add a new measure to our DHQ visualizations...</a>
