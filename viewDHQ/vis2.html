<p><strong>Who, when included in a work's bibliography, gets cited specifically a lot in the text of that article?</strong> Edge weights are numbers representing how many times an item in a work's bibliography appears in that work's main text; this visualization filters for edge weights of greater than 14, highlighting citations that were mentioned more than 13 times in the main text of the article (because weight of 1 means a node was in the bibliography but not mentioned in the main text).</p>
<p>Compared to the first-pass visualization, this image highlights the 12 citations in the DHQ dataset that have the highest rate of being mentioned within the text of an article. There are many reasons a given citation may be multiply mentioned within the main text of an article: highly unique language requiring frequent quotation, moving back and forth between points from more than one source, or an article that focuses on debating a previous work are all reasons for greater edge weights, and might or might not signify the importance of a given work within the DH knowledge network. More work might be done by some simple coding of the nodes as to their use within a work to reveal whether such frequent mentions are the product of a quality specific to the node or the structure of the work citing it.</p>
<p>
Note that within our dataset, we're using the "< bibl xml:id >" descriptor to label nodes (individual works from DHQ or elsewhere); for example, "< bibl xml:id="dospassos1930" >" refers to a work published in 1930 by Dos Passos. Thus, we can identify among the works highlighted by this visualization Matthew Kirschenbaum's 2008 <em>Mechanisms</em> and Katherine Hayles' 2008 <em>Electronic Literature: New Horizons for the Literary</em>--which seem like important works that might be mentioned often--but also note that other assumedly important DH works (e.g. Vannevar Bush's 1945 "As We May Think") that are highlighted by other visualizations don't appear here. Let's <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis3.html">try a different measure of citation importance...</a>
