<h1>4. Document similarity: compare every article pair (doc-doc)</h1>
<img src="4small.png"><br>
<p>Because the currently small size of the DHQ article set (110 articles) doesn't yet allow for significant statements about the flow of knowledge among these articles, I introduced an additional measure to these visualizations: document similarity. MITH's Travis Brown ran a topic modeling procedure to provide datasets comparing the vocabulary of DHQ articles to other DHQ articles as well as exploring how well a given topic (think set of thematically related words) fit an article.</p>
<p>This visualization looks at the former (document to document) dataset: paired nodes each representing two DHQ articles, with the color of the edge between each pair signifying <strong>how similar their topics are</strong>. This visualization isn't very useful as is; the only thing that sticks out visually is the DHQ article 000032.xml (Raphael Finkel's <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/003/1/000032/000032.html">"What Your Teacher Told You is True: Latin Verbs Have Four Principal Parts"</a>), a quick skim of which shows that it is syntactically quite different from the bulk of DHQ articles--so, while this visualization needs some finessing to be visually useful, the dataset seems to be succesfully identifying similarity and difference among the DHQ articles. Now, <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis5.html">let's look closer at the document similarity measure...</a><br>
