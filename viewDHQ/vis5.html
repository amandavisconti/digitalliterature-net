<p>This visualization shows the ten DHQ articles that the topic modeling procedure identified as most similar (the outlier article mentioned in the last visualization description, 000032.xml, was removed first). A quick skim of these articles reveals some obvious similarities as well as some mysteries in terms of how the articles are similar (the ID numbers are individual DHQ article IDs):</p>

Some similarities are obviously thematic ("Reading Potential: The Oulipo and the Meaning of Algorithms" and "Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original Adventure in Code and in Kentucky" both discuss games and play). Other articles may seem to discuss quite different issues while still employing a highly similar vocabulary; "Reading Potential: The Oulipo and the Meaning of Algorithms" and "The Potential and Problems in using High Performance Computing in the Arts and Humanities: the Researching e-Science Analysis of Census Holdings (ReACH)" shared a closeness to a topic containing fairly decontextualized words such as work, time, university, see, same, and make.
