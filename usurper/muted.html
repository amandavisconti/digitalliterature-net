Here Stephen has been entirely removed. I left in any text not directly pointing to Stephen's existence, but replaced a few redundant "Buck Mulligan"s with "he" and repurposed some of the "you"s that pointed to Stephen as part of self-directed monologues.

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;</span><span class="c3 c0">Introibo ad altare Dei</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs; solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. He made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. The shaking gurgling face, equine in its length, the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Back to barracks! he said sternly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He added in a preacher&#39;s tone:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the current, will you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He skipped off the gunrest, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;The mockery of it! he said gaily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. He propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck. His gay voice went on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;My name is absurd: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn&#39;t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. He laid the brush aside, laughing with delight. Ceasing, he began to shave with care.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;God, isn&#39;t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He shaved warily over his chin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. He frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Scutter! he cried thickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He came over to the gunrest and wiped the razorblade neatly. He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;God! he said quietly. Isn&#39;t the sea what Algy calls it: a grey sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. </span><span class="c3 c0">Epi oinopa ponton</span><span class="c0">. Ah, the Greeks! You must read them in the original. </span><span class="c3 c0">Thalatta! Thalatta</span><span class="c0">! She is our great sweet mother. Our mighty mother! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea. He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant smile curled his lips. He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously. The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade. He attacked the hollow beneath his underlip. He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin. He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk. Laughing again, he brought the mirror away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan suddenly walked round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea. He&#39;s stinking with money and thinks you&#39;re not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, I might do something for the island. Hellenise it. And to think of your having to beg from these swine. Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I&#39;ll bring down Seymour and we&#39;ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;halt</span><span class="c0">ed, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes. Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I can&#39;t remember anything. I remember only ideas and sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God? What did I say? I forget.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan&#39;s cheek.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He shook his constraint from him nervously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;And what is death? I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It&#39;s a beastly thing and nothing else. It simply doesn&#39;t matter. To me it&#39;s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it&#39;s over. Absurd! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had spoken himself into boldness. He swung round on his heel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He walked off quickly round the parapet. A voice within the tower called loudly:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Are you up there, Mulligan?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I&#39;m coming, Buck Mulligan answered. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I&#39;m inconsequent. Give up the moody brooding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">And no more turn aside and brood<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon love&#39;s bitter mystery<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; For Fergus rules the brazen cars.<br></span><span class="c0">A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green. Buck Mulligan&#39;s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the staircase, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">O, won&#39;t we have a merry time,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Drinking whisky, beer and wine!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; On coronation,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Coronation day!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; O, won&#39;t we have a merry time<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; On coronation day!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan&#39;s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;We&#39;ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Have you the key? a voice asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Janey Mack, I&#39;m choked! he howled, without looking up from the fire:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway, looking out. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I&#39;m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Bread, butter, honey. Haines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. Where&#39;s the sugar? O, jay, there&#39;s no milk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight. I want Sandycove milk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;That woman is coming up with the milk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I can&#39;t go fumbling at the damned eggs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on plates, saying:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;</span><span class="c3 c0">In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Haines sat down to pour out the tea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I&#39;m giving two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman&#39;s wheedling voice:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I makes water I makes water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;</span><span class="c3 c0">So I do, Mrs Cahill,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;says she. </span><span class="c0 c3">Begob, ma&#39;am,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;says Mrs Cahill, </span><span class="c3 c0">God send you don&#39;t make them in the one pot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He lunged towards his messmate a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;That&#39;s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Can you recall, is mother Grogan&#39;s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan&#39;s face smiled with delight. Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">&mdash;For old Mary Ann<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; She doesn&#39;t care a damn.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; But, hising up her petticoats...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned. The doorway was darkened by an entering form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;The milk, sir!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Come in, ma&#39;am, Mulligan said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An old woman came forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;That&#39;s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure! The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;How much, sir? asked the old woman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;It is indeed, ma&#39;am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Taste it, sir, she said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He drank at her bidding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn&#39;t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives&#39; spits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I am, ma&#39;am, Buck Mulligan answered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Look at that now. Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the west, sir?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I am an Englishman, Haines answered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;He&#39;s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I&#39;m ashamed I don&#39;t speak the language myself. I&#39;m told it&#39;s a grand language by them that knows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Would you like a cup, ma&#39;am?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Haines said to her:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn&#39;t we?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it&#39;s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That&#39;s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;A miracle!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give. We&#39;ll owe twopence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning, sir.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan&#39;s tender chant:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">&mdash;Heart of my heart, were it more,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; More would be laid at your feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He turned and said:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Seriously, I&#39;m stony. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan sighed tragically. He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Mulligan is stripped of his garments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He emptied his pockets on to the table, and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. Haines called from the doorway:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Are you coming, you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I&#39;m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;And going forth he met Butterly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He clubbed with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Down, sir! How dare you, sir!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Haines asked:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Do you pay rent for this tower?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea. But ours is the </span><span class="c3 c0">omphalos</span><span class="c0">. Wait till I have a few pints in me first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He turned as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It&#39;s quite simple. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;What? Haines said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck, bending in loose laughter. Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue, he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;I mean to say, Haines explained, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. </span><span class="c3 c0">That beetles o&#39;er his base into the sea,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;isn&#39;t it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant but did not speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;It&#39;s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again. I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at him, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll&#39;s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">&mdash;I&#39;m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; My mother&#39;s a jew, my father&#39;s a bird.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; So here&#39;s to disciples and Calvary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He held up a forefinger of warning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">&mdash;If anyone thinks that I amn&#39;t divine<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; He&#39;ll get no free drinks when I&#39;m making the wine<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; But have to drink water and wish it were plain<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; That I make when the wine becomes water again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">R</span><span class="c0">unning forward to a brow of the cliff, he fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">&mdash;Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; What&#39;s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; And Olivet&#39;s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He capered down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury&#39;s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back his brief birdsweet cries. Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Oughtn&#39;t to laugh, I suppose. He&#39;s rather blasphemous. I&#39;m not a believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn&#39;t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb, helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and lit his cigarette.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Either you believe or you don&#39;t, isn&#39;t it? Personally I couldn&#39;t stomach that idea of a personal God. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He walked on and detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;An Irishman must think like that, I daresay. It seems history is to blame. Of course I&#39;m a Britisher, and I feel as one. I don&#39;t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That&#39;s our national problem, I&#39;m afraid, just now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;She&#39;s making for Bullock harbour.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;There&#39;s five fathoms out there, he said. It&#39;ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one. It&#39;s nine days today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Is the brother with you, Malachi?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth. Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Seymour&#39;s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Is she up the pole?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Better ask Seymour that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Redheaded women buck like goats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I&#39;m the </span><span class="c3 c0">Uebermensch.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Are you going in here, Malachi?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Yes. Make room in the bed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake Zarathustra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His plump body plunged.</span></p>
