The idea here was simple: see what "Telemachus" reads like without "being distracted by" Stephen's thoughts. Some judgement calls on whether a given sentence was Stephen's private thoughts a different focalization were exercised.

<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">Introibo ad altare Dei</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Back to barracks! he said sternly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He added in a preacher&#39;s tone:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the current, will you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan&#39;s gay voice went on.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn&#39;t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Will he come? The jejune jesuit!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ceasing, he began to shave with care.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Yes, my love?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;God, isn&#39;t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks you&#39;re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner. He can&#39;t make you out. O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He shaved warily over his chin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is his guncase?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark with a man I don&#39;t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther. You saved men from drowning. I&#39;m not a hero, however. If he stays on here I am off.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Scutter! he cried thickly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen&#39;s upper pocket, said:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The bard&#39;s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. You can almost taste it, can&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;God! he said quietly. Isn&#39;t the sea what Algy calls it: a grey sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. </span><span class="c0">Epi oinopa ponton</span><span class="c1">. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the original. </span><span class="c0">Thalatta! Thalatta</span><span class="c1">! She is our great sweet mother. Come and look.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen&#39;s face.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That&#39;s why she won&#39;t let me have anything to do with you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I&#39;m hyperborean as much as you. But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant smile curled his lips.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt and a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;They fit well enough, Stephen answered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God knows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey. You&#39;ll look spiffing in them. I&#39;m not joking, Kinch. You look damn well when you&#39;re dressed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Thanks, Stephen said. I can&#39;t wear them if they are grey.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;He can&#39;t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror. Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can&#39;t wear grey trousers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.p.i. He&#39;s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General paralysis of the insane!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I pinched it out of the skivvy&#39;s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her all right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen&#39;s peering eyes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If Wilde were only alive to see you!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked looking-glass of a servant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen&#39;s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;It&#39;s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. God knows you have more spirit than any of them. Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea. He&#39;s stinking with money and thinks you&#39;re not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island. Hellenise it. And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I&#39;m the only one that knows what you are. Why don&#39;t you trust me more? What have you up your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I&#39;ll bring down Seymour and we&#39;ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Let him stay, Stephen said. There&#39;s nothing wrong with him except at night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I&#39;m quite frank with you. What have you against me now?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don&#39;t remember anything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He looked in Stephen&#39;s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen said:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother&#39;s death?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;What? Where? I can&#39;t remember anything. I remember only ideas and sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;You said, Stephen answered, </span><span class="c0">O, it&#39;s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan&#39;s cheek.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He shook his constraint from him nervously.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;And what is death, he asked, your mother&#39;s or yours or my own? You saw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It&#39;s a beastly thing and nothing else. It simply doesn&#39;t matter. You wouldn&#39;t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it&#39;s injected the wrong way. To me it&#39;s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it&#39;s over. You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don&#39;t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette&#39;s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn&#39;t mean to offend the memory of your mother.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen said very coldly:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. A voice within the tower called loudly:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Are you up there, Mulligan?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I&#39;m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He turned towards Stephen and said:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Don&#39;t mope over it all day, he said. I&#39;m inconsequent. Give up the moody brooding.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">And no more turn aside and brood<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon love&#39;s bitter mystery<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; For Fergus rules the brazen cars.</span><span class="c1"><br>A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Kinch ahoy!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan&#39;s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the staircase, calling again. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is apologising for waking us last night. It&#39;s all right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I&#39;m coming, Stephen said, turning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Do, for Jesus&#39; sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our sakes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His head disappeared and reappeared.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it&#39;s very clever. Touch him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I get paid this morning, Stephen said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;If you want it, Stephen said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We&#39;ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">O, won&#39;t we have a merry time,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Drinking whisky, beer and wine!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; On coronation,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Coronation day!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; O, won&#39;t we have a merry time<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; On coronation day!</span><span class="c1"><br>The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet. He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan&#39;s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;We&#39;ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Have you the key? a voice asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I&#39;m choked!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He howled, without looking up from the fire:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Kinch!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;It&#39;s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I&#39;m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. Where&#39;s the sugar? O, jay, there&#39;s no milk.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There&#39;s a lemon in the locker.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove milk.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;That woman is coming up with the milk.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I can&#39;t go fumbling at the damned eggs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines sat down to pour out the tea.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I&#39;m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman&#39;s wheedling voice:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I makes water I makes water.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">So I do, Mrs Cahill,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;says she. </span><span class="c0">Begob, ma&#39;am,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;says Mrs Cahill, </span><span class="c0">God send you don&#39;t make them in the one pot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;That&#39;s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan&#39;s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan&#39;s face smiled with delight.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">&mdash;For old Mary Ann<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; She doesn&#39;t care a damn.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; But, hising up her petticoats...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The doorway was darkened by an entering form.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The milk, sir!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Come in, ma&#39;am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen&#39;s elbow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;That&#39;s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;How much, sir? asked the old woman.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;A quart, Stephen said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;It is indeed, ma&#39;am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Taste it, sir, she said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He drank at her bidding.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn&#39;t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives&#39; spits.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I am, ma&#39;am, Buck Mulligan answered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Look at that now, she said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen listened in scornful silence. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the west, sir?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I am an Englishman, Haines answered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;He&#39;s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I&#39;m ashamed I don&#39;t speak the language myself. I&#39;m told it&#39;s a grand language by them that knows.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma&#39;am?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines said to her:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn&#39;t we?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen filled again the three cups.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it&#39;s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That&#39;s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;A miracle!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;We&#39;ll owe twopence, he said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning, sir.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan&#39;s tender chant:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">&mdash;Heart of my heart, were it more,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; More would be laid at your feet.</span><span class="c1"><br>He turned to Stephen and said:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Seriously, Dedalus. I&#39;m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then he said to Haines:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me. That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen&#39;s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m sure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the milkwoman or from him. It&#39;s a toss up, I think.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen&#39;s arm.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;From me, Kinch, he said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In a suddenly changed tone he added:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;To tell you the God&#39;s truth I think you&#39;re right. Damn all else they are good for. Why don&#39;t you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Let us get out of the kip.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Mulligan is stripped of his garments.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He emptied his pockets on to the table.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;There&#39;s your snotrag, he said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. A limp black missile flew out of his hands.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;And there&#39;s your Latin quarter hat, he said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the doorway:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Are you coming, you fellows?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I&#39;m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out, Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;And going forth he met Butterly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Did you bring the key?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Down, sir! How dare you, sir!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines asked:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Do you pay rent for this tower?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea. But ours is the </span><span class="c0">omphalos</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I&#39;m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I have a few pints in me first.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;You couldn&#39;t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It&#39;s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet&#39;s grandson is Shakespeare&#39;s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen&#39;s ear:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;We&#39;re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is rather long to tell.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. </span><span class="c0">That beetles o&#39;er his base into the sea,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;isn&#39;t it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;It&#39;s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll&#39;s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">&mdash;I&#39;m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; My mother&#39;s a jew, my father&#39;s a bird.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; So here&#39;s to disciples and Calvary.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He held up a forefinger of warning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">&mdash;If anyone thinks that I amn&#39;t divine<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; He&#39;ll get no free drinks when I&#39;m making the wine<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; But have to drink water and wish it were plain<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; That I make when the wine becomes water again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He tugged swiftly at Stephen&#39;s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">&mdash;Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; What&#39;s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; And Olivet&#39;s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury&#39;s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;We oughtn&#39;t to laugh, I suppose. He&#39;s rather blasphemous. I&#39;m not a believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn&#39;t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;O, Haines said, you have heard it before?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;You&#39;re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;There&#39;s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or you don&#39;t, isn&#39;t it? Personally I couldn&#39;t stomach that idea of a personal God. You don&#39;t stand for that, I suppose?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He walked on, trailing his ashplant by his side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. A wavering line along the path. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;After all, Haines began...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen turned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your own master, it seems to me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Italian? Haines said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame. Of course I&#39;m a Britisher, Haines&#39;s voice said, and I feel as one. I don&#39;t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That&#39;s our national problem, I&#39;m afraid, just now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;She&#39;s making for Bullock harbour.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;There&#39;s five fathoms out there, he said. It&#39;ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one. It&#39;s nine days today.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Is the brother with you, Malachi?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Seymour&#39;s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with money.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Is she up the pole?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Better ask Seymour that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Redheaded women buck like goats.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I&#39;m the </span><span class="c0">Uebermensch.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Are you going in here, Malachi?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Yes. Make room in the bed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen turned away.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;I&#39;m going, Mulligan, he said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake Zarathustra.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His plump body plunged.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;We&#39;ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Good, Stephen said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He walked along the upwardcurving path. A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning the curve he waved his hand. It called again. </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
